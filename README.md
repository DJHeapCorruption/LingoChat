# LingoChat

This web application was designed with the aim of helping language learners communicate, meet, and perhaps even become friends with others who are similarly interested in language exchange.

LingoChat showcases third-party APIs such as jQuery and TailwindCSS, as well as server-side APIs such as OpenStreetMap and FreeDictionary.

## Usage

The application can be accessed [here](https://colcob98.github.io/LingoChat/).

After creating a profile based on their language learning preferences, users can select an area on a map in which they would prefer to meet, thereby displaying other users in the area.

Once choosing a potential language learning partner from the list of local language learners, the user can communicate with them through a chatting window. In anticipation of communication difficulties between people of different langauge backgrounds, the chatting window is equipped with a dictionary feature, allowing users to resolve any areas of confusion that may occur in conversation.
